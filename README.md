# Halo-Halo Numpad!
A custom PCB implementation of a numpad that I designed for my girlfriend. 
(The name comes from a popular Filipino dessert; we thought it would be a fun name)

## Specifications
This numpad includes a 5x4 matrix of MX-style key switches along with a column of 
rotary encoders with a push-on switch built-in. 

At the moment, the board is still a WIP. The final board will include headers to attach a microcontroller that
will be chosen later. There should also be space for a small OLED/LCD screen. 

### To-do: 
	- [] Choose a microcontroller to use
	- [] Add headers for microcontroller chosen 
	- [] Add space on PCB for the small screen
