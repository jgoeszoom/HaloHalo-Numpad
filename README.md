# Halo-Halo Numpad!
A custom PCB implementation of a numpad that I designed for my girlfriend. 

## Specifications
This numpad includes a 5x4 matrix of MX-style key switches along with a column of 
rotary encoders with a push-on switch built-in. 

At the moment, the final board will include headers to attach a microcontroller that
will be chosen later. There should also be space for a small OLED/LCD screen.
