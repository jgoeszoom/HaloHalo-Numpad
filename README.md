# Halo-Halo Numpad!
A custom PCB implementation of a numpad that I designed for my girlfriend. 
(The name comes from a popular Filipino dessert; we thought it would be a fun name)

## Specifications
This numpad includes a 5x4 matrix of MX-style key switches along with a column of 
rotary encoders with a push-on switch built-in. 

At the moment, the board is still a WIP. The final board will include headers to attach a microcontroller that
will be chosen later. There should also be space for a small OLED/LCD screen. 

### To-do: 
	- [X] Choose a microcontroller to use
	- [X] Add headers for microcontroller chosen 
	- [] Update corresponding PDFs and images
	- [] Add space on PCB for the small screen

Included in the BOM directory is an HTML for an interactive BOM generated by a plugin in KiCAD. 
When this is opened, a rendered HTML page shows all the items on the PCB as well as their location
and values and footprints. It's a nice side by side view of a BOM and the PCB.
